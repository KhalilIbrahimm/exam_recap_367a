# Rethinking Transformers Pre-training for Multi-Spectral Satellite Imagery

## Problem they are trying to solve / Purpose of method

- Unsupervised pre-training.
- Satellite imagery changes over time.
- Multi-Spectral bands contains much more information than just RGB.
- Different ground sample distances for the bands.
- How do we better utilze the multi-spectral information?.

- What are the previous problems that needs to be solved?
- Why is the method introduced/needed?

## How does it differ from other methods?

- SatMAE
- ScaleMAE

__Needs more details__

__images maybe?__

- Compare what is different from other methods.
- What makes this method unique?

## How the method works

Builds upon SatMAE. Uses multiple scales of the input image during
training.

__Need more details__

__add image__

- Explain the details of the method, simple overview first,
then more details.
