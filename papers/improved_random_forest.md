# An improved random forest based on the classification accuracy and correlation measurement of decision trees

## Problem they are trying to solve / Purpose of method

Traditional Random Forests is an ensemble of decision trees.
It is trained on bootstrap samples. Uses majority voting.
All this reduces overfitting.

Issues:

1. Low quality trees
2. High correlation between trees
3. Unstable evaluation

Earlier approaches have only addressed one of the issues.

## How does it differ from other methods?

It addresses all issues at the same time.

## How the method works

1. Keep only high quality trees
2. Removes highly correlated trees
3. Balanced tree selection process
